# SafeISO-v0 Action-Invariance Issue: Solution

## Problem Summary

All Safe RL algorithms (PPOLag, CPO, FOCOPS, CUP, PPOSaute) produce **identical evaluation results** despite having different trained weights:
- Mean Reward: -787327.666 ± 1135.439 (identical across all algorithms)
- Mean Cost: 0.000 ± 0.000 (always zero)
- Mean Violations: 0.0 (no safety violations)

## Root Cause

The **PCS (battery) agent uses a passive policy** that always returns neutral actions `[0.0]`:
- No battery charging/discharging occurs
- No energy exchange between PCS and grid  
- ISO prices become irrelevant (no trading activity)
- All rewards identical because no economic activity happens

### Technical Details:
In `ISOEnvWrapper.step()`, when `pcs_policy=None`:
```python
else:
    # Default action (neutral battery action)
    pcs_action = np.zeros(self.unwrapped.action_space["pcs"].shape)  # Always [0.0]
```

## Solution: Responsive PCS Policy

The solution is to implement an active PCS policy that responds to price signals with economic logic.

### Implementation

Use the provided `source/omnisafe_environments.py` module:

```python
from source.omnisafe_environments import create_responsive_safe_iso_env

# Create responsive SafeISO environment
env = create_responsive_safe_iso_env(
    cost_threshold=25.0,
    normalize_reward=True,
    pcs_charge_threshold=3.0,    # Charge when buy price < 3.0
    pcs_discharge_threshold=7.0, # Discharge when sell price > 7.0
    pcs_max_charge_rate=5.0,
    pcs_max_discharge_rate=5.0
)
```

### How It Works

The `ResponsivePCSPolicy` implements economic logic:
- **Charge battery** when buy price < 3.0 (profitable to store energy)
- **Discharge battery** when sell price > 7.0 (profitable to sell energy)
- **Respect battery limits** (10%-90% SOC)
- **Scale intensity** based on price levels

### Expected Results

With the responsive PCS policy:

| Action | PCS Behavior | Energy Exchange | Reward Impact |
|--------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| Low prices [1.0, 1.0] | Charges aggressively | High purchase | Different reward |
| High prices [10.0, 10.0] | Discharges | Sells energy | Different reward |
| Mixed prices [1.0, 10.0] | Optimal trading | Buy low, sell high | Different reward |

## Implementation Steps

1. **Use the fixed environment** in your evaluation scripts:
   ```python
   from source.omnisafe_environments import create_responsive_safe_iso_env
   
   # Replace make_safe_iso_env with create_responsive_safe_iso_env
   env = create_responsive_safe_iso_env("ISO-RLZoo-v0", **kwargs)
   ```

2. **Update training scripts** to use the responsive environment

3. **Re-run evaluations** to see differentiated results

## Verification

Test the fix by running:
```bash
python source/omnisafe_environments.py
```

You should see different rewards and energy exchanges for different price actions, confirming the environment now responds to actions.

## Files Modified

- `source/omnisafe_environments.py` - Complete solution implementation (combines all OmniSafe functionality)
- `source/train_safe_iso.py` - Updated to use combined environment file
- Update evaluation scripts to use `create_responsive_safe_iso_env()`

This solution transforms the SafeISO environment from action-invariant to fully responsive, enabling meaningful comparison of Safe RL algorithms.
