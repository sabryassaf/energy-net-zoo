# Safe RL System File Summaries

## omnisafe_environments.py
**Purpose**: Complete OmniSafe environment system with action-invariance fix.
- **ResponsivePCSPolicy**: Economic logic that reacts to price signals (charge low, discharge high)
- **SafeISOCMDP**: OmniSafe-compatible CMDP wrapper with tensor conversions
- **Logging patches**: Fixes energy_net TypeError and suppresses spam messages
- **Action-invariance fix**: Replaces passive PCS policy to make environment responsive
- **All-in-one**: Contains all OmniSafe functionality in single file

## safe_iso_wrapper.py
**Purpose**: Core safety wrapper that adds constraints to the ISO environment.
- Implements 4 safety constraints: voltage, frequency, battery, supply-demand
- Calculates safety costs and tracks violations
- Provides action/observation spaces for compatibility
- **Key**: Where safety constraints are actually enforced

## train_safe_iso.py
**Purpose**: Training script using OmniSafe for Safe RL algorithms.
- Creates OmniSafe agents with proper configuration
- Uses responsive environment (omnisafe_environments.py)
- Handles algorithm mapping and logging setup
- **Core**: Where actual Safe RL training happens

## evaluate_models.sh + evaluate_models.sbatch
**Purpose**: Comprehensive evaluation system for trained models.
- **Shell script**: Finds and evaluates models across all algorithms
- **SLURM batch**: Submits evaluation jobs to cluster
- **Responsive environment**: Uses fixed environment for meaningful comparisons
- **Results**: Generates JSON results and summary reports

## fix_env_registration.py
**Purpose**: Fixes environment registration issues.
- Sets proper episode lengths (500 steps instead of 48)
- Handles environment re-registration warnings

## System Flow
1. **Training**: `train_safe_iso.py` → uses `omnisafe_environments.py` → wraps `safe_iso_wrapper.py`
2. **Evaluation**: `evaluate_models.sbatch` → runs `evaluate_models.sh` → uses responsive environment
3. **Key Fix**: ResponsivePCSPolicy makes environment respond to actions (no more identical results)

## Major Achievement
**Action-Invariance Bug FIXED**: Environment now produces different results for different algorithms instead of identical outputs. PPOLag, CPO, FOCOPS, CUP, and PPOSaute now show meaningful performance differences enabling proper Safe RL research.
