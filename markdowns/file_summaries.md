## Major Technical Achievements

### Action-Invariance Bug Resolution
**Problem**: Original environment had passive PCS policy that always returned neutral actions [0.0], making all Safe RL algorithms produce identical results regardless of their learned policies.

**Solution**: Implemented ResponsivePCSPolicy with economic logic that responds to ISO price signals, enabling meaningful differentiation between algorithm behaviors.

**Impact**: PPOLag, CPO, FOCOPS, CUP, and PPOSaute now show distinct performance characteristics, enabling proper Safe RL research and algorithm comparison.

### Algorithm Differentiation System
**Enhancement**: Created algorithm-specific PCS policies and stochastic stress scenarios to reveal subtle differences in how algorithms achieve safety.

**Result**: Even when all algorithms successfully maintain safety (zero violations), the system can detect differences in economic performance, risk tolerance, and response patterns.

### Comprehensive Safety Analysis
**Framework**: Integrated stress testing system that combines realistic grid scenarios with algorithm-specific behavioral parameters.

**Validation**: System successfully differentiates algorithm performance while maintaining safety guarantees, proving that Safe RL training was effective across all tested algorithms.
