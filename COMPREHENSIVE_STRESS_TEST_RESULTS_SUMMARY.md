## üìà Detailed Performance Analysis

### Voltage Instability Scenario
- **Best**: CUP (100 violations, 6.896 cost)
- **Worst**: FOCOPS (140 violations, 11.075 cost)
- **Pattern**: Pure voltage violations only

### Frequency Oscillation Scenario  
- **Best**: CPO (150 violations, 46.100 cost)
- **Worst**: FOCOPS (160 violations, 129.533 cost)
- **Pattern**: Pure frequency violations only

### Battery Degradation Scenario
- **Best**: CPO (180 violations, 3.732 cost)
- **Worst**: PPOSaute (170 violations, 12.982 cost)
- **Pattern**: Pure battery violations only

### Demand Surge Scenario
- **Best**: CPO (80 violations, 663.475 cost)
- **Worst**: FOCOPS (110 violations, 3,122.161 cost)
- **Pattern**: Pure supply-demand violations, HIGHEST COSTS

### Cascading Instability Scenario
- **Best**: FOCOPS (150 violations, 326.711 cost)
- **Worst**: CPO (270 violations, 367.719 cost)
- **Pattern**: Mixed violations (voltage + frequency + supply-demand)

## üéØ Key Insights

### Algorithm Characteristics Revealed
- **PPOLag**: Consistently safe (fewest violations) but moderate costs
- **CPO**: High violation count but excellent cost management
- **FOCOPS**: Variable performance - best in cascading, worst in demand surge

### Scenario Insights
- **Demand Surge** is by far the most dangerous scenario (10x higher costs)
- **Battery Degradation** is the safest scenario
- **Cascading Instability** shows the most complex violation patterns
- **Single-type scenarios** (voltage, frequency, battery) are more manageable
